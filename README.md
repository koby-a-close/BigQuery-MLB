# BigQuery-MLB
MLB Data using Google BigQuery Public Dataset

These are SQL queries and python code I am using to analyze the Google dataset pitchFX data for MLB in 2016.

Queries written:
> Box Score for every game
>> Final home and away records for every team

Python:
> Box Score query ---> Final home and away records for every team
>> Box Score query ---> Home and away records for every team at every date in season
